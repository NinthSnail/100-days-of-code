# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 10 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started learning React using Dev Ed tutorial. Learning state management while building a Movies app. 
    1. Created MoviesList.js component 
    2. Create Movie.js component
    3. Created Nav.js component
    4. Initialized MovieList component with list of movies data and then send it to the Movie component.
    5. Displayed all the movie list on main App.js component using props

**Thoughts:** Getting to know about react app components, useState and hooks. How to use props to send data from one component to another. Learnt how to design a navigation bar. Learnt how to send data across components using props.
